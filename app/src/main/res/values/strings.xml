    <string name="virText">How to Play the Game: \n \nThe goal of the game is to place a queen piece in each row and each column
        so that they do not share a row, column, or diagonal with any other queen on the board. Click on colored squares, starting
        from the left, to make queens appear. You are only allowed to place 1 queen in each column and must only place queens in
        the column next to your last move. If a move is not allowed a message will appear to let you know why. To remove a queen,
        click on the queen that is furthest right and continue left to remove more. You will not be allowed to remove a queen if
        there are queens placed right of it, you must go back through and remove the others first. If you would like to remove all
        of the queens on your board and start fresh, click the \'Clear\' button in the bottom left corner. If you are stuck and want to
        be shown if there are any solutions left click the \'Give Up\' button in the bottom right corner. Thanks for playing!</string>
